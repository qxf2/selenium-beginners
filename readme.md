Learn Selenium using examples:
--------
Selenium lets you control the browser through a script. Selenium lets you interact with browsers in a manner similar to real users interacting with browsers. We present small code samples that help you learn selenium from scratch using Python. 

There are example code for some of the most commonly performed actions on a webpage like navigating to a URL, fill in the text, click buttons, hover over elements, choose drop downs, validate text, etc. 

--------
Motivation for creating this repository
--------
We noticed that people learning selenium think it would take a lot of effort and time and hence would never start learning it. Working through this example you will notice how easy it is to get started and perform various actions on a webpage. We hope you can learn selenium quickly by following these example code.

This code is a companion to a Selenium tutorial (aimed at newbies) we presented as part of the Mangaluru Software Testing Group. This page was created by Qxf2 Services (http://qxf2.com) and Mangalore Infotech (http://mangaloreinfotech.in/) to help testers practice Selenium. 

Qxf2 provides QA consultancy services for startups. If you found this repository useful, please let us know by giving us a star on GitHub.

Setup:
--------
a. Install Python 2.x

b. If you do not have it already, get pip

c. Add both to your PATH environment variable

d. Install Selenium (pip install Selenium)

e. Download Geckodriver (https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) and add it to your PATH environment variable

f. Open command prompt and run the test using command eg: *python 01_Navigate_Url.py*

Pro tip: Once you are setup, try your best to timebox each exercise to no more than 10-minutes. We recommend this tip for even rank beginners who know nearly nothing about Selenium and Python!
