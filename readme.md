This page was created by __Qxf2 Services__ (http://qxf2.com) and __Mangalore Infotech__ (http://mangaloreinfotech.in/) to help testers practice Selenium. Selenium lets you control the browser through a script. Selenium lets you interact with browsers in a manner similar to real users interacting with browsers. For example, you can fill in text, click buttons, hover over elements, chose drop downs, validate text, etc.

__NOTE:__ This code is a companion to a Selenium tutoral (aimed at newbies) we presented as part of the Mangaluru Software Testing Group.
